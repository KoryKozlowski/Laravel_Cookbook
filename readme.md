This is a repository corresponding to the various "recipes" contained within the _Laravel Application Development Cookbook_. 

Each commit corresponds to one or more recipe encapsulating one or more important practice of a practical web application. 

As each recipe is completed, I add any additionally created views to the index (hello.php) so that the project may be viewed and navigated with ease.
